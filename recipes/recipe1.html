		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>Everyday for the past year, I have been waking up and preparing the same boring breakfast for myself before I head out for school, work, or exercise. One Saturday morning, I came to a realization- this is not the life that I was destined to live. Thus, I thought to myself, "<i>what would I enjoy eating right now?</i>" Among the many delectable options, there were a few that stood out, each with their own complications:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			Cereal. This wouldn't work; too much milk to sit right in my stomach, not enough opportunity for creativity, and far less nutrients than desired.
			</li>
			<li>
			Eggs and bacon. This was too boring; I wouldn't enjoy every bite like I want to be.
			</li>
			<li>
			Doughnuts. Ah, what I would do for a doughnut and coffee for my breakfast, while sitting on a balcony, staring at the sunrise. Unfortunately, I live in America, and not Venice, so there's not much to stare at outside other than industrialization, and I can't get away with having a doughnut every morning without my body hating me.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h4><strong>So what was I going to make?</strong></h4>
