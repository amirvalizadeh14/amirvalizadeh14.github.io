		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>Everyday for the past year, I have been waking up and preparing the same boring breakfast for myself before I head out for school, work, or exercise. One Saturday morning, I came to a realization- this is not the life that I was destined to live. Thus, I thought to myself, "<i>what would I enjoy eating right now?</i>" Among the many delectable options, there were a few that stood out, each with their own complications:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			Cereal. This wouldn't work; too much milk to sit right in my stomach, not enough opportunity for creativity, and far less nutrients than desired.
			</li>
			<li>
			Eggs and bacon. This was too boring; I wouldn't enjoy every bite like I want to be.
			</li>
			<li>
			Doughnuts. Ah, what I would do for a doughnut and coffee for my breakfast, while sitting on a balcony, staring at the sunrise. Unfortunately, I live in America, and not Venice, so there's not much to stare at outside other than industrialization, and I can't get away with having a doughnut every morning without my body hating me.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h4><strong>So what was I going to make?</strong></h4>
		<h3><strong>Protein Pancakes!</strong></h3>
		<h4>Why, you might ask?</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>
				They are super easy to prepare and make (10-15 minutes total)
			</li>
			<li>
				They are very fun to eat, with lots of bursting flavors due to the diverse, harmonious ingredients used
			</li>
			<li>
				They are packed with essential macronutrients and micronutrients, which are essential to kickstart your day with a smile
			</li>
		</ul>

			<p><br>A quote from my parents to emphasize the beauty of the pancakes:</p>
			<blockquote>When we first saw him preparing these pancakes, we were sure that the taste would be hindered by the addition of protein powder into the mix. But, after we tried them, we could then proudly exclaim that these are even better than restraurant pancakes!
