## Glycolysis

Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm and involves the breakdown of one molecule of glucose $(C6H12O6)$ into two molecules of pyruvate $(C3H3O3)$. The net products are 2 ATP molecules, 2 NADH molecules, and 2 pyruvate molecules. The steps of glycolysis are as follows:

### 1. Phosphorylation

* ATP gets hydrolyzed, losing a phosphate and converting to ADP

$ATP + H2O \to ADP + P_i + energy$

$$ x2 $$

$C6 + P_i \to$ Glucose 6-phosphate + Fructose 6-phosphate
